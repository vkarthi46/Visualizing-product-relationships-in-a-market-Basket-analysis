Market basket is a widely used analytical tool in retail industry. However, retail industry use it extensively, this is no way an indication that the usage is limited to retail industry.  Various X-sell strategies in different industries can be made using a market basket analysis. There is a good amount of content available in the web world on the theory behind market basket analysis.

Some basic Definitions

Support : Support is simply the probability of an event  to occur. If we have an event to buy a product A, Support(A) is simple the number of transactions which includes A divided by total number of transactions.

Confidence : Confidence is essentially the conditional probability of an event A happening given that B has happened.

Graphical representation of market basket analysis makes the interpretation of the entire puzzle of “probabilities/conditional probability/lift above random events” much simpler than a tabular format. This simplification can be more appreciated when we have a large number of transactions and product list. In case of large lists, we can simply find out using the dimension of product sign and width of the line connecting them to infer out simple rules which otherwise were buried in a matrix of complex probabilities.
